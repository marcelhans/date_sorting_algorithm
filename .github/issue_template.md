Hey there and thank you for using Issue Tracker and help us to improve our project!

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). We use StackOverflow for usage question and GitHub for bugs.
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Post the feature request on our Projects section on GitHub and mark the importance of the feature. GitHub issues should only be used for bugs. 
  
None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** / [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) example that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] What's the **version** of React Native you're using?
- [ ] Does this occur on iOS, Android or both?
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
